This repository contains source code for a mission file for the game ArmA 3, essentially, a custom game mode for the sandbox.

In this mission file, you get spawned in the air, inside of a helicopter, within the confines of a fixed area on the map.

The goal is to fly around and shoot down other players in the area, if you get damaged and are able to land, you may repair the vehicle and heal your player.
